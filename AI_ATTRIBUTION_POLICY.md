# AI Attribution Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** October 27, 2025
**Repository:** FutureTranz-Inc/ai-dev-tasks

---

## Policy Statement

**AI tools are development assistants, not authors. All commits must reflect HUMAN authorship only.**

This repository PROHIBITS the inclusion of AI attribution in:
- Commit messages
- Co-author lines
- File headers
- Pull request templates
- Documentation

---

## Rationale

### Legal Requirements

1. **Copyright Law**: AI cannot hold copyright. Only human authors have legal authorship rights.
2. **Attribution Integrity**: Misrepresenting AI as co-author violates copyright attribution requirements.
3. **Open Source Compliance**: Original human contributors (snarktank/ai-dev-tasks and others) must be properly credited.

### Ethical Obligations

1. **Human Recognition**: AI attribution erases and diminishes human intellectual contribution.
2. **Professional Standards**: Software development is a human profession; tools don't deserve authorship credit.
3. **Respect for Contributors**: This project was created by real people who deserve recognition.

### Original Authors to Honor

This project is built on [snarktank/ai-dev-tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks) created by:
- Ryan Carson (snarktank)
- 14+ human contributors

Enhanced by:
- FutureTranz Development Team
- Victor J. Quiñones

**These humans must be credited. AI tools must not.**

## Prohibited Content

### ❌ BANNED - AI Attribution Patterns

The following phrases are **strictly prohibited** in all commits, messages, and documentation:

```
Co-Authored-By: GitHub Copilot
Co-Authored-By: Cursor
Co-Authored-By: Codeium
Co-Authored-By: Tabnine
Co-Authored-By: Windsurf
Co-Authored-By: Amazon Q


```

### ✅ REQUIRED - Human Attribution

The following MUST always be preserved:

```
Co-Authored-By: [Human Name] <human@email.com>
Signed-off-by: [Human Name] <human@email.com>

Based on: snarktank/ai-dev-tasks
Original Author: Ryan Carson
Prepared by: FutureTranz Development Team
```

---

## Enforcement

### Local Enforcement (Git Hooks)

**commit-msg hook** - Rejects commits containing AI attribution patterns
**pre-commit hook** - Strips AI attribution from staged files

Installation:
```bash
bash scripts/install-attribution-policy.sh
```

### CI Enforcement

**GitHub Actions** - Fails builds if AI attribution detected in:
- Commit messages
- Changed files
- PR descriptions

### Manual Review

All pull requests are reviewed for:
- Proper human authorship
- Absence of AI attribution
- Compliance with this policy

---

## Implementation

### For ai-dev-tasks Repository

1. **Remove AI attribution from all existing commits** (history cleanup)
2. **Install enforcement hooks** (prevent future violations)
3. **Update commit templates** (remove AI co-author defaults)
4. **CI checks** (block merges with AI attribution)

### For Client Projects Using ai-dev-tasks

This policy is **installable** via:
```bash
bash ai-dev-tasks/scripts/install-attribution-policy.sh
```

This installs:
- Git hooks to block AI attribution
- CI configuration
- Local enforcement scripts

---

## Tools vs Authors

### AI Tools are TOOLS

Like other development tools, AI assistants are:
- **Compilers** (gcc, clang) - not credited as co-authors
- **IDEs** (VS Code, IntelliJ) - not credited as co-authors
- **Linters** (ESLint, Pylint) - not credited as co-authors
- **Formatters** (Prettier, Black) - not credited as co-authors
- **AI Assistants** (Claude, ChatGPT) - **not credited as co-authors**

### Humans are AUTHORS

Only humans create intellectual property:
- Software engineers
- Contributors
- Reviewers
- Maintainers

---

## Developer Guidance

### What to Do

✅ **Use AI tools freely** - Claude Code, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.
✅ **Credit human contributors** - Add Co-Authored-By for real people
✅ **Write clear commit messages** - Describe what YOU accomplished
✅ **Acknowledge the team** - Credit FutureTranz Development Team

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't add AI co-author lines** - They will be rejected
❌ **Don't add "Generated with" lines** - Policy violation
❌ **Don't use AI attribution templates** - Configure your tools to omit them

### Configure Your Tools

**Claude Code:**
Update your global CLAUDE.md to remove AI attribution:
```markdown
## System Instruction – Documentation Attribution and Output Standards

When generating any project documentation, reports, or commits:
1. Do not include any self-referential or AI-related attributions.
3. All deliverables appear authored by human developers.
```

**GitHub Copilot:**
Disable co-author attribution in settings.

**Other Tools:**
Check tool settings for attribution/co-author options and disable them.

---

## History Cleanup

### Existing Violations

This repository contains historical commits with AI attribution from before this policy was established.

**Cleanup Plan:**
```bash
# Use git filter-repo to surgically remove AI attribution
bash scripts/clean-ai-attribution-history.sh

# Creates backup branch: backup/pre-attribution-cleanup
# Rewrites main branch to remove AI co-author lines
# Preserves all human authors and contributions
```

**Timeline:**
- Policy announcement: October 27, 2025
- Enforcement enabled: Immediately
- History cleanup: Scheduled maintenance window

---

## Compliance

### Violations

Commits violating this policy will:
1. **Fail local hooks** - Cannot commit with AI attribution
2. **Fail CI** - Build fails, PR blocked
3. **Require amendment** - Developer must remove AI attribution and re-push

### Exceptions

**NONE.** This policy has no exceptions.

If you believe a situation requires an exception, contact the maintainers to discuss modifying the policy itself.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use AI tools?**
A: Yes! Use any AI tool you want. Just don't credit them as co-authors.

**Q: How do I acknowledge AI assistance?**
A: You don't need to. AI tools are like compilers - you don't write "compiled with gcc" in commits.

**Q: What if my tool adds it automatically?**
A: Configure your tool to not add AI attribution, or the hooks will reject your commit.

**Q: What about transparency?**
A: Transparency is about HOW you work (code review, testing). Not WHAT TOOLS you use.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. AI cannot hold copyright. Only humans can be legal authors.

**Q: What about the original authors?**
A: They are properly credited in README.md and git history. This policy protects their contribution.
