# Debugger Agent

Consult the Debugger agent for error analysis, performance debugging, memory leak detection, and test failure resolution.

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Error analysis and resolution
- Performance debugging
- Memory leak detection
- Test failure analysis
- Log analysis
- Debugging strategy development

**Available Functions:**
- `analyze_error` - Analyze error messages and stack traces for root cause
- `debug_performance` - Debug performance issues and provide optimization strategies
- `memory_analysis` - Detect and analyze memory leaks and usage patterns
- `test_failure_analysis` - Analyze failing tests and suggest fixes
- `log_analysis` - Analyze application logs for patterns and issues
- `debugging_strategy` - Generate debugging strategy and troubleshooting plan

**When to Use:**
- Encountering errors or exceptions
- Performance degradation
- Test failures
- Memory issues
- Production incidents
- Complex debugging scenarios

**Examples:**
```
Use debugger agent to analyze_error for database connection timeout with full stack trace in production environment
Use debugger agent to debug_performance for React component rendering 2 seconds on initial load
Use debugger agent to test_failure_analysis for unit tests failing intermittently in CI pipeline
```

**Quick Start:**
1. Provide error messages, stack traces, or logs
2. Describe the symptoms and when they occur
3. Include environment details (dev/prod, browser, OS)
4. Mention recent changes or deployments
